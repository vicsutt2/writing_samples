# Context for Writing Samples

## Writing Sample #1: Consent Form
> The following writing sample is a consent form I produced while giving private flute lessons to high school students. This document provides information to the student and their guardian and serves as a receipt for our agreed upon expectations prior to starting lessons.

## Writing Sample #2: Diagram of Essay Components
> The following writing sample is a diagram I produced while working as an undergraduate tutor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s writing center. A large portion of my job consists of explaining academic writing fundamentals to freshmen, such as how to write a thesis, structure an essay, or follow a specific style guide. Due to how often I repeat this information, I created this diagram to improve my efficiency and my clients' engagement during the tutoring session.Please note, I typically use this diagram in conjunction with a verbal explanation to appeal to both auditory and visual learning styles.

## Writing Sample #3: Excerpt from a Research Paper
> The following writing sample is an excerpt of a 16-page research paper I wrote for the University Honors Program’s interdisciplinary course. I was selected to present this paper at the Southern Regional Honors Council’s annual conference in early 2020 as well. My research explores the historical and cultural reasons behind gender inequality in authoritative positions of instrumental music (i.e. conductors, principal musicians soloists, and educators). The excerpt I have provided focuses primarily on employment demographics.
